                    Sustainable Development Goal 3 of the 2030 Agenda for 
                    Sustainable Development aims to "ensure healthy lives and
                    promote well-being for all at all ages." This goal includes several 
                    targets, such as reducing the global maternal mortality ratio, preventing 
                    deaths of newborns and children, ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, 
                    and other communicable diseases, lowering mortality from non-communicable diseases,
                    enhancing the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, halving the number of deaths
                    and injuries from road traffic accidents, ensuring universal access to sexual and 
                    reproductive health-care services, achieving universal health coverage, 
                    and decreasing deaths and illnesses caused by hazardous chemicals and pollution.

                    To achieve the maternal and child health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
                    UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon launched the Every Woman Every Child initiative 
                    at the United Nations Millennium Development Goals Summit in September 2010.

                    This global movement mobilizes international and national action by governments,
                    multilateral organizations, the private sector, and civil society to tackle major
                    health challenges faced by women and children worldwide. The movement operationalizes
                    the Global Strategy for Women and Children's Health, providing a roadmap to enhance 
                    financing, strengthen policies, 
                    and improve services for the most vulnerable women and children.

                    The Commission on Sustainable Development treated health and sustainable development 
                    as interconnected issues in its multi-year work program. Health and 
                    Sustainable Development were also key themes at the World Summit on 
                    Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002. The Summit's outcome document,
                    the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, dedicates Chapter 6 to Health and
                    Sustainable Development. It asserts that people are entitled to healthy, productive 
                    lives in harmony with nature and that sustainable development goals can only be 
                    achieved without a high prevalence of debilitating diseases. Achieving 
                    health gains for the entire population requires poverty eradication.
